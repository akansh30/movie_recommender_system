**Movie Recommender System**
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on their similarity using cosine similarity. The recommendations are generated based on the movie tags.

**Steps to Run the Project:**
Run the Main.ipynb file to generate the necessary files (similarity.pkl and movies_list.pkl):

```bash
jupyter notebook Main.ipynb
```

Run the Streamlit app to launch the Movie Recommender System:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
